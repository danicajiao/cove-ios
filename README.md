## Signup Walkthrough

- Left is signing up with a Social Provider (Google). Facebook sign up is also supported. Once I get an Apple Developer Account, Apple sign up will also be supported.
- Right is signing up with an email (Firebase).
- Both methods will create a user entry with Firebase Authentication.

## Contributing

### Branching
This project follows trunk-based development where each branch is tied to an Issue. This projects Issues can be found [here](https://github.com/danicajiao/cove-ios/issues).

For example, to start working on an Issue with id `#14` and label `feature` the convention is to name the branch `feature/14-issue-desc`. That is, all lowercase, starting
with the label, followed by a forward-slash, then a short description starting with the Issue id in kebab case.

Here are some more examples:
- `feature/21-another-desc`
- `bug/3-bug-desc`
- `docs/10-doc-impl`

### Pull Requests
In order to make best use of GitHubs auto-referencing feature, pull request titles or descriptions should contain keywords like "closes" or "resolves" followed by the Issue number it relates to like follows:
- `This PR closes #21`
- `This PR resolves danicajiao/cove-ios#3`

This will then auto-link the PR to the issue(s) and will close them once the PR is merged.

## More to come

Everything seen so far is subject to change overtime as I move along with development.
