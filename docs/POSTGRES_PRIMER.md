# Postgres Primer

A focused ramp-up on the Postgres concepts Cove's backend depends on. The goal is not a comprehensive tutorial — it's the specific knowledge you need before Phase 3 schema work begins.

## The database layout

Cove runs one CNPG `Cluster` (`cove-db`) hosting a single database (`cove`). Inside that database, each service owns its own schema (`directory`, `catalog`, `user`). This primer covers the Postgres *mechanics* those schemas rely on; the **canonical schema, entities, and service ownership live in [Marketplace Architecture](MARKETPLACE_ARCHITECTURE.md)** — refer there for the actual table definitions. The examples below are illustrative.

Each service connects with a Postgres role whose `search_path` is set to its own schema, so application queries stay unqualified — `SELECT * FROM items` inside `cove-item` works without ever typing `catalog.items`. Cross-schema references (e.g., `user.favorites` → `catalog.items`, `catalog.items.maker_id` → `directory.makers`) use real foreign keys, since all schemas live in the same database.

### Why one cluster, not one per service

The microservices-textbook answer is "one database per service." That trade-off is correct at FAANG scale where per-service teams, failure-isolation budgets, and compliance boundaries all matter. None of those conditions apply at Cove's v1 scale (one developer, one node, one product surface). What does apply is the cost of giving up referential integrity, JOINs, and atomic writes — every user-centric feature becomes a distributed systems problem when its references cross cluster boundaries. One cluster with schemas keeps logical service ownership while preserving Postgres's relational guarantees. See [Marketplace Architecture](MARKETPLACE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full rationale.

Compare to Firestore:

| Firestore | Postgres |
|---|---|
| Collection | Table |
| Document | Row |
| Field | Column |
| No schema enforcement | Column types enforced at write time |
| Schemaless | Schema-first |

## Schemas and search_path

A Postgres **schema** is a namespace inside a database — a way to group tables, functions, and types. Every database starts with a `public` schema.

```sql
-- These are equivalent inside the `catalog` schema:
SELECT * FROM items;
SELECT * FROM public.items;
```

`search_path` is the ordered list of schemas Postgres checks when you use an unqualified name. The default is `public` first:

```sql
SHOW search_path;
-- "$user", public
```

**How Cove uses this:** CNPG provisions the `cove` database, then bootstrap migrations create the per-service schemas plus a role per service, each with its `search_path` scoped to its own schema (so application queries stay unqualified — `SELECT * FROM items` resolves inside `cove-item`). Extensions like `ltree` and `postgis` live in `public` so they're reachable from any schema. The full bootstrap (schemas, roles, cross-schema grants) is in [Marketplace Architecture](MARKETPLACE_ARCHITECTURE.md); the mechanic to understand here is `search_path`:

```sql
-- A role whose unqualified queries resolve against its own schema first
ALTER ROLE cove_item SET search_path = catalog, public;
```

Cross-schema foreign keys are the unlock that makes the single-cluster model practical:

```sql
-- A favorite that physically lives in the `user` schema but references
-- a row in the `catalog` schema. Postgres enforces this — INSERT fails
-- if the item doesn't exist; deleting the item CASCADEs the favorite.
CREATE TABLE "user".favorites (
    uid     text NOT NULL REFERENCES "user".users(uid)    ON DELETE CASCADE,
    item_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES catalog.items(id)   ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (uid, item_id)
);
```

---

## Indexes: B-tree, GIN, and partial

Postgres has several index types. Three matter for Cove:

### B-tree (the default)

B-tree handles equality, range queries, and sorting. It's what you get with a plain `CREATE INDEX`.

```sql
-- Good: equality and range on a scalar column
CREATE INDEX ON items (category_id);
CREATE INDEX ON items (price_cents);
CREATE INDEX ON items (created_at DESC);

-- Postgres uses the index for:
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category_id = $1;
SELECT * FROM items WHERE price_cents BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000;
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

B-tree cannot index inside JSONB values or full-text vectors — use GIN for those.

### GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)

GIN indexes the *contents* of a composite value — every key in a JSONB object, every lexeme in a tsvector, every element in an array. It's slower to build and update than B-tree but the only practical choice for:

- JSONB containment queries (`@>`)
- Full-text search (`@@`)
- Array membership

```sql
-- Index JSONB attributes for containment queries
CREATE INDEX ON items USING GIN (attributes);

-- Index the full-text search vector
CREATE INDEX ON items USING GIN (search_vec);

-- Postgres uses the index for:
SELECT * FROM items WHERE attributes @> '{"diet": "organic"}';
SELECT * FROM items WHERE search_vec @@ to_tsquery('english', 'honey');
```

### Partial indexes

A partial index only covers rows that match a `WHERE` clause. Smaller, faster, and the right tool when a large fraction of rows are irrelevant to most queries.

```sql
-- Only index active items — inactive ones are never shown to users
CREATE INDEX ON items (category_id) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Only index unread notifications
CREATE INDEX ON notifications (user_id, created_at DESC) WHERE read_at IS NULL;
```

The query must include the same condition to use the index:

```sql
-- Uses the partial index
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category_id = $1 AND is_active = true;

-- Falls back to seq scan — condition doesn't match the partial index filter
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category_id = $1;
```

---

## EXPLAIN ANALYZE

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` runs a query and shows the actual execution plan with real timings. Use it whenever a query is slower than expected.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.price_cents
FROM items p
WHERE p.category_id = 'abc123'
  AND p.is_active = true
ORDER BY p.price_cents
LIMIT 20;
```

Example output:

```
Limit  (cost=0.43..18.64 rows=20 width=48) (actual time=0.051..0.142 rows=20 loops=1)
  ->  Index Scan using items_category_id_idx on items p
        (cost=0.43..91.20 rows=100 width=48) (actual time=0.049..0.131 rows=20 loops=1)
        Index Cond: (category_id = 'abc123'::uuid)
        Filter: (is_active = true)
Planning Time: 0.3 ms
Execution Time: 0.2 ms
```

**How to read it:**

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| `cost=X..Y` | Planner estimate. First number = startup cost, second = total cost. Arbitrary units. |
| `actual time=X..Y` | Real wall-clock milliseconds. First = first row, second = all rows. |
| `rows=N` | Estimated (in cost) vs actual (in actual time) row count. Big gaps here mean stale statistics — run `ANALYZE items`. |
| `loops=N` | How many times this node ran. Multiply `actual time` by `loops` for true cost. |
| `Index Scan` | Used an index — good. |
| `Seq Scan` | Scanned the full table. Fine on small tables; investigate on large ones. |
| `Filter` | Applied after index lookup, not part of the index condition. Rows removed here are wasted work — consider a better index. |
| `Bitmap Heap Scan` | Used an index to collect matching row locations, then fetched them. Common when many rows match. |

**Common patterns to look for:**

```sql
-- High rows estimate vs actual: run ANALYZE
ANALYZE items;

-- Seq Scan on a large table: missing index
CREATE INDEX ON items (producer_id);

-- Index Scan but Filter removes most rows: wrong index or need partial index
CREATE INDEX ON items (producer_id) WHERE is_active = true;
```

---

## Transactions and isolation levels

A **transaction** is a group of operations that either all succeed or all fail. In Postgres, every statement runs inside a transaction — even bare `INSERT`/`UPDATE` statements are auto-committed.

```sql
-- Explicit transaction: reserve an item and create a notification atomically
BEGIN;

UPDATE items
SET reserved_by = $1, reserved_at = now()
WHERE id = $2 AND reserved_by IS NULL;

INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, type, payload)
VALUES ($1, 'reservation_confirmed', jsonb_build_object('item_id', $2));

COMMIT;  -- both writes land, or neither does
```

If anything between `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` fails, `ROLLBACK` undoes everything.

### Isolation levels

Isolation controls what a transaction can see from concurrent transactions. Postgres has four levels; two matter in practice:

| Level | Default? | What it sees |
|---|---|---|
| `READ COMMITTED` | ✅ yes | Only committed data. Each statement sees a fresh snapshot. Two reads of the same row in one transaction can return different values if another transaction commits between them. |
| `REPEATABLE READ` | No | Snapshot taken at transaction start. Same row returns the same value throughout the transaction, even if another transaction commits. |
| `SERIALIZABLE` | No | Full serializability — transactions behave as if they ran one at a time. Highest protection, occasional retry on conflict. |

**Read committed is almost always right for Cove.** The main exception is multi-step read-then-write operations where consistency across reads matters:

```sql
-- Repeatable read: ensure the item count doesn't change between the
-- check and the insert
BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

SELECT count(*) FROM items WHERE producer_id = $1;
-- ... application logic based on the count ...
INSERT INTO items (...) VALUES (...);

COMMIT;
```

### Watch out for: long transactions

A transaction holds locks and prevents Postgres from vacuuming dead rows for its duration. Keep transactions short — open them, do the work, commit immediately. Never hold a transaction open waiting for user input or an external API call.

## JSONB

JSONB stores JSON as a binary decomposed structure — indexed, queryable, and faster than `json` (which stores raw text). Use it for attributes that vary by item type so the `items` table doesn't need 50 nullable columns.

```sql
-- items table: fixed columns for things every item has,
-- JSONB for the rest
CREATE TABLE items (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name        text NOT NULL,
    price_cents integer NOT NULL,
    category_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES categories(id),
    attributes  jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    is_active   boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Honey: {"diet": "organic", "weight_g": 500, "flower_source": "wildflower"}
-- Cheese: {"diet": "vegetarian", "weight_g": 200, "milk_type": "sheep"}
-- Vegetables: {"diet": "organic", "unit": "bunch"}
```

### Operators

| Operator | Returns | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `attributes -> 'diet'` | `jsonb` | Get value as JSON (`"organic"`) |
| `attributes ->> 'diet'` | `text` | Get value as text (`organic`) — use this in `WHERE` |
| `attributes @> '{"diet": "organic"}'` | `boolean` | Does attributes contain this JSON? |
| `attributes ? 'weight_g'` | `boolean` | Does the key exist? |

```sql
-- All organic items (GIN index on attributes makes this fast)
SELECT * FROM items WHERE attributes @> '{"diet": "organic"}';

-- Items under 300g (cast the text value to integer for comparison)
SELECT * FROM items WHERE (attributes ->> 'weight_g')::integer < 300;

-- Items that have a flower_source attribute at all
SELECT * FROM items WHERE attributes ? 'flower_source';

-- Build a JSONB object in a query
SELECT jsonb_build_object(
    'id', id,
    'name', name,
    'diet', attributes ->> 'diet'
) FROM items;
```

### GIN index on JSONB

```sql
-- Covers all @> containment queries and ? key-exists queries
CREATE INDEX ON items USING GIN (attributes);
```

### JSONB vs a normalized table

Use JSONB when:
- Attributes vary significantly by category (honey has `flower_source`, vegetables don't)
- You query by value (`WHERE attributes @> '{"diet": "organic"}'`) but don't JOIN on individual attributes
- The attribute set evolves without schema migrations

Use a normalized column when:
- Every row has the value (e.g., `price_cents`, `name`)
- You JOIN on it or use it in ORDER BY / GROUP BY
- You need foreign key constraints on it

---

## Full-text search with tsvector and tsquery

Postgres has built-in full-text search. `tsvector` is a pre-processed representation of a document (normalized words + positions). `tsquery` is a search expression. The `@@` operator checks if a query matches a vector.

### Setting it up

Store the search vector as a generated column so it stays in sync with the source columns automatically:

```sql
ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN search_vec tsvector
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        to_tsvector('english',
            coalesce(name, '') || ' ' ||
            coalesce(description, '')
        )
    ) STORED;

CREATE INDEX ON items USING GIN (search_vec);
```

### Querying

```sql
-- Simple word search
SELECT id, name FROM items
WHERE search_vec @@ to_tsquery('english', 'honey');

-- AND: both words must appear
SELECT id, name FROM items
WHERE search_vec @@ to_tsquery('english', 'raw & honey');

-- OR: either word
SELECT id, name FROM items
WHERE search_vec @@ to_tsquery('english', 'honey | jam');

-- Prefix match (useful for autocomplete)
SELECT id, name FROM items
WHERE search_vec @@ to_tsquery('english', 'hon:*');

-- Ranked results — ts_rank scores how well a document matches
SELECT id, name, ts_rank(search_vec, query) AS rank
FROM items, to_tsquery('english', 'organic & honey') query
WHERE search_vec @@ query
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### websearch_to_tsquery

For user-typed search strings, `websearch_to_tsquery` is more forgiving than `to_tsquery` — it handles phrases, quoted strings, and doesn't throw on invalid syntax:

```sql
-- Handles "raw honey" as a phrase, "organic -processed" as negation
SELECT id, name FROM items
WHERE search_vec @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english', $1);
```

---

## Category hierarchy with ltree

`ltree` is a Postgres extension for representing and querying tree-structured data. Categories in Cove form a hierarchy (Produce → Vegetables → Root Vegetables), and `ltree` makes ancestor/descendant queries fast without recursive CTEs.

### Enable the extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ltree;
```

CNPG provisioning will handle this — the extension is declared in the `Cluster` spec.

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id   uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name text NOT NULL,
    path ltree NOT NULL UNIQUE  -- e.g. 'produce.vegetables.root_vegetables'
);

CREATE INDEX ON categories USING GIST (path);
CREATE INDEX ON categories USING BTREE (path);

-- Items reference categories by id, not by path
-- (path can change on rename; id never changes)
ALTER TABLE items ADD CONSTRAINT fk_category
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id);
```

### Path notation

Labels are dot-separated. Each label must be alphanumeric + underscores.

```
produce
produce.vegetables
produce.vegetables.root_vegetables
produce.dairy
produce.dairy.cheese
```

### Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `path <@ 'produce'` | Is path a descendant of `produce`? | `produce.dairy` → true |
| `path @> 'produce.dairy.cheese'` | Is path an ancestor of the given path? | `produce` → true |
| `path ~ 'produce.*{1}'` | lquery pattern match (one level deep) | `produce.vegetables` → true |
| `path ? ARRAY[...]` | Matches any of the lquery patterns? | |
| `nlevel(path)` | Depth of the path | `produce.dairy` → 2 |
| `subpath(path, 0, 2)` | First 2 labels | `produce.vegetables.root` → `produce.vegetables` |

### Common queries

```sql
-- All descendants of produce (any depth)
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE path <@ 'produce';

-- Direct children of produce only (one level deeper)
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE path ~ 'produce.*{1}';

-- All items in any vegetable subcategory
SELECT p.*
FROM items p
JOIN categories c ON c.id = p.category_id
WHERE c.path <@ 'produce.vegetables';

-- Breadcrumb: ancestors of a given category, root first
SELECT * FROM categories
WHERE path @> (SELECT path FROM categories WHERE id = $1)
ORDER BY nlevel(path);

-- Subtree root: strip the last label to get the parent
SELECT subpath(path, 0, nlevel(path) - 1) AS parent_path
FROM categories
WHERE id = $1;
```

### Why not a `parent_id` adjacency list?

A `parent_id` column requires a recursive CTE (`WITH RECURSIVE`) to traverse the tree. Recursive CTEs work but are verbose and harder to index efficiently. `ltree` turns any depth traversal into a single indexed operator — cleaner to write, faster to execute.

---

## Geospatial search with PostGIS

Cove's core query is "what's near me." Discovery is gated by a radius: storefronts within N miles of the user. The right tool for this on Postgres is **PostGIS** — an extension that adds spatial types, functions, and index support.

### Why not a B-tree on lat/long, or geohashing?

- **B-tree fails** because it's a one-dimensional ordered structure. "Within 20 miles" is a 2D query over latitude *and* longitude simultaneously; a B-tree can range-scan one dimension but not both together, so it can't answer proximity efficiently.
- **Application-level geohashing** (encoding lat/long into a prefix string) is a real technique, but it's the wrong tool *on Postgres*. Geohash cells break at boundaries — two points 10m apart can land in different cells — so you'd query neighboring cells and re-filter by exact distance anyway. It shines on key-value stores (Redis) that lack native spatial support; Postgres has PostGIS.

### The PostGIS approach

A `geography` column stores a point as longitude/latitude on a spheroid (SRID 4326 = WGS84). A **GiST index** makes radius queries fast, and `ST_DWithin` computes true great-circle distance:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;

-- geography(Point, 4326): lon/lat on the earth's spheroid
ALTER TABLE storefronts ADD COLUMN location geography(Point, 4326);
CREATE INDEX ON storefronts USING GIST (location);

-- Insert a point — note ST_MakePoint takes (longitude, latitude) order
UPDATE storefronts SET location = ST_MakePoint(-104.99, 39.74)::geography
WHERE id = $1;
```

### `geography` vs `geometry`

PostGIS has two spatial types. The distinction matters:

| Type | Coordinate system | Distance unit | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `geography` | Spheroid (real earth) | **meters** | Real-world lat/long, distances across cities/regions — **Cove's case** |
| `geometry` | Flat plane | coordinate units | Projected/local data, or when you've already projected to a planar SRID |

`geography` does the right thing for "miles from a point" without you handling projection math. The cost is slightly slower computation — irrelevant at Cove's scale.

### Radius query

`ST_DWithin(a, b, meters)` returns true if two points are within the given distance. It uses the GiST index, so it's fast:

```sql
-- Storefronts within 20 miles of downtown Denver.
-- ST_DWithin on geography takes METERS — 20 mi = 32186.9 m. This is the
-- single most common gotcha: geography = meters, always.
SELECT id, name, ST_Distance(location, ST_MakePoint(-104.99, 39.74)::geography) AS distance_m
FROM storefronts
WHERE ST_DWithin(location, ST_MakePoint(-104.99, 39.74)::geography, 32186.9)
ORDER BY distance_m;
```

`ST_Distance` returns the actual distance (also in meters for `geography`), useful for displaying "2.1 mi away" or feeding a proximity term into a ranking `ORDER BY`.

### Infra note

PostGIS is **not** bundled in vanilla Postgres images the way `ltree` is — it must be installed and the extension enabled. On the homelab CNPG cluster this means using a PostGIS-enabled image and declaring the extension before any geospatial schema work. See [Marketplace Architecture](MARKETPLACE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the discovery query blends `ST_DWithin` proximity with full-text relevance and trust scoring.

## Quick reference

```sql
-- Most common operations

-- Containment (needs GIN index on attributes)
WHERE attributes @> '{"diet": "organic"}'

-- Text value from JSONB
WHERE (attributes ->> 'weight_g')::integer < 300

-- Full-text search (needs GIN index on search_vec)
WHERE search_vec @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english', $1)

-- All items in a category subtree (needs GIST index on path)
JOIN categories c ON c.id = p.category_id WHERE c.path <@ 'produce'

-- Direct children of a category
WHERE path ~ 'produce.*{1}'

-- Points within a radius (needs GIST index on a geography column; meters!)
WHERE ST_DWithin(location, ST_MakePoint($lon, $lat)::geography, 32186.9)

-- Read query plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...

-- Refresh statistics after large data loads
ANALYZE items;
```

## Glossary

Quick lookups for terms used throughout. For full context, see the corresponding sections above.

**B-tree** — The default Postgres index type. Used for equality, range queries, and sorting on scalar columns. Created with a plain `CREATE INDEX`.

**Cross-schema FK** — A foreign key whose target column lives in a different schema in the same database (e.g. `"user".favorites.item_id` → `catalog.items(id)`). Works natively; foundational to Cove's single-cluster-schemas-per-service topology.

**EXPLAIN ANALYZE** — A Postgres command that runs a query and reports the actual execution plan with wall-clock timings. The first tool to reach for when a query is slower than expected.

**Generated column** — A column whose value is computed by an expression over other columns in the same row. `STORED` keeps the result on disk so it can be indexed. Used for `search_vec` to keep it in sync with `name` + `description` automatically.

**GIN** — Generalized Inverted Index. Indexes the *contents* of composite values: JSONB keys, array elements, tsvector lexemes. Required for `@>` containment, `?` key-exists, and `@@` full-text matches.

**GiST** — Generalized Search Tree. The index type used by `ltree` for hierarchical operators (`<@`, `@>`, `~`) and by PostGIS for spatial proximity (`ST_DWithin`).

**geography (PostGIS)** — A spatial column type storing lon/lat points on the earth's spheroid (SRID 4326). Distances are in **meters**. Indexed with GiST; queried with `ST_DWithin` (radius) and `ST_Distance` (exact distance). Preferred over `geometry` for real-world location data.

**PostGIS** — Postgres extension adding spatial types, functions, and index support. Not bundled in vanilla Postgres — must be installed and enabled. Powers Cove's "within N miles" discovery gate.

**ST_DWithin** — PostGIS function returning true if two geographies are within a given distance (meters, for `geography`). Uses the GiST index, so radius filters are fast.

**JSONB** — Binary-stored, queryable, indexable JSON. Preferred over `json` for any column you'll query. Operators: `->` (get as JSONB), `->>` (get as text), `@>` (contains), `?` (key exists).

**ltree** — Postgres extension that stores hierarchical labels as a single dot-separated column (`food.produce.honey`). Operators include `<@` (is descendant of), `@>` (is ancestor of), `~` (matches lquery pattern), `nlevel()` (depth).

**Partial index** — An index with a `WHERE` clause covering only matching rows. Smaller, faster, and the right tool when most rows are irrelevant to most queries (e.g., active items only).

**Read committed** — Postgres's default isolation level. Each statement sees a fresh snapshot of committed data. Two reads of the same row in one transaction may return different values if another transaction committed in between.

**Repeatable read** — An isolation level where the entire transaction sees the snapshot taken at its start. Use when you need consistency across multiple reads in one transaction.

**Role** — A Postgres "user" with login and permission grants. Services connect as their own role (`cove_item`, `cove_user`) so schema ownership is enforced at the database level.

**Schema** — A namespace inside a Postgres database that groups tables, functions, and types. Cove uses one schema per service (`directory`, `catalog`, `user`) within a single `cove` database.

**search_path** — Ordered list of schemas Postgres checks for unqualified names. Each service's role has its own schema first, so application queries stay unqualified (`SELECT * FROM items` works inside `cove-item` because `search_path = catalog, public`).

**Serializable** — The strictest isolation level — transactions behave as if they ran one at a time. Rarely needed; comes with occasional retry on conflict.

**tsquery** — A search expression parsed from user input (via `to_tsquery` or `websearch_to_tsquery`). Combined with `@@` to match against a tsvector.

**tsvector** — Pre-processed representation of a document (normalized lexemes + positions) used for full-text search. Typically stored as a generated column from `name` + `description` and indexed with GIN.

**websearch_to_tsquery** — A forgiving tsquery parser for user-typed search input. Handles phrases (`"raw honey"`), negations (`organic -processed`), and never throws on invalid syntax. Use this for app search bars; use `to_tsquery` for programmatic queries.
