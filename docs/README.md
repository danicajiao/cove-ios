- **[App Architecture](APP_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - How the app is structured and how data flows
  - MVVM pattern and ViewModels
  - Authentication and navigation
  - Product type system
  - Firebase data model and Firestore queries

### CI/CD
- **[CI/CD Workflows](CI_CD_WORKFLOWS.md)** - All workflows, versioning, and deployment

### Architecture (Planned)
- **[Backend Infrastructure](BACKEND_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)** - Planned infrastructure: K3s, GCP API Gateway, Cloudflare Tunnel, migration phases
- **[Marketplace Architecture](MARKETPLACE_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Planned data layer: hybrid SQL, NoSQL & GraphQL backend
