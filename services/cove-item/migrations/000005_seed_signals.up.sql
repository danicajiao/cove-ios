-- Signal taxonomy seed.
-- verification_method values:
--   'api_lookup'        — automated check against a public API (e.g. USDA NOP)
--   'directory_crossref'— manual or scraped lookup against a public member directory
--   'manual_review'     — staff reviews submitted documents / attestation
--   'kyc'               — automated identity verification via Stripe Identity or Persona
--
-- weight reflects acquisition cost / credibility signal to buyers (1 = baseline, 3 = highest).
-- has_expiry = true means the signal must be re-verified on renewal; the expiry job
-- reads this flag to know which entity_signals rows to monitor.
